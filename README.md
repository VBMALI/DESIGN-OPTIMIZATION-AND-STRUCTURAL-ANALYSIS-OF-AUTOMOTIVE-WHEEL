# DESIGN-OPTIMIZATION-AND-STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS-OF-AUTOMOTIVE-WHEEL
An automotive wheel is under the design process. The preliminary model of the wheel is provided as a starting point for the analysis and design modification. The input model is over-designed. There is input from vehicle dynamics team in terms of the dead load carried by each wheel. There is an input from the tire manufacturer in terms of the required tire pressure for better performance on the road. Based on the provided inputs, we need to modify the design of the wheel so that it falls within the allowable design limits. The allowable design limit is determined by the factor of safety for wheel under applied loading conditions. Over design would cause excessive cost of the part and the under design would cause the failure. The project discuss about inputs, assumptions, design modifications and the respective results.
